Commercial Plug-ins

IdMUnit's architecture is modular so new functionality can be added without modifying the base project.  Some of these plug-ins include new connectors for IdMUnit, new data injectors, etc.

Currently the most popular commercial plug-ins consist of the following:

*TriVir Data Reconciliation Toolkit - Test the state of data in all connected system to identify attributes or object out of sync
*Connector for Java Message Service (JMS) Queue
*Connector for RSA Authentication SecurID server
*Connector for Exchange 2007
