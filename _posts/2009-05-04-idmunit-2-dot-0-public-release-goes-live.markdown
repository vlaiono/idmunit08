 Special thanks to those engineers at TriVir who have made this project a priority as they strive to perfect their craft.  Also this project would be impossible without the creative idea machine provided by our diverse client√®le.  You'll find the release package [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/idmunit/files/latest/download). 

Included in the package you'll find the binary distribution, source distribution and a Flash demo.  Checkout the IdMUnit World-wide Webinar that took place on go-live day [here](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=185903&package_id=321370&release_id=680658).
