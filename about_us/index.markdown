*The IdMUnit Project Team* is made up of engineers from *TriVir, LLC* and from a number of their clients and partners.  Everyone working with identity management solutions is welcome to participate.  Newcomers may start by downloading the code and leveraging it within their own environments.  For those who would like to participate at the developer level, please send requests to [info@trivir.com](mailto:info@trivir.com?subject=IdMUnit Project Contributions).

*TriVir, LLC* was founded in 2003 by a small group of former Novell consultants and engineers. These tried and tested professionals have many years of experience in delivering proven, real-world solutions. This experience has given them a deep understanding of networks and network-associated technologies.  

This background in real-world experience allows TriVir to deliver practical solutions that can transform a complex maze of cables and machinery into an easy-to-use, secure computing network. 

TriVir's goal is to reduce maintenance requirements and cut administrative costs for all clients through effective design and thoughtful planning.  Learn more at [www.TriVir.com](http://www.trivir.com).
